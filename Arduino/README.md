## PWM DC Motor Control
PWM, or pulse width modulation is a technique which allows us to adjust the average value of the voltage thatâ€™s going to the electronic device by turning on and off the power at a fast rate. The average voltage depends on the duty cycle, or the amount of time the signal is ON versus the amount of time the signal is OFF in a single period of time.
