 #### A code to demonstrate the following on Arduino and STM_NUCLEO_F410RE board:
* Working of servo
* I2C communication
* Running L298 motor driver
* Performing serial communication. 


#### OpenCV
To create a module to detect a line made of black tape on a court
using python OpenCV.
For testing purposes use your webcam, plain page with line drawn with
sketch pen or marker. The line once detected should be enclosed in a
red box.
Mention in the report the steps used and create a process workflow
diagram for the same.
Also mention the required changes in the code that have to be made if
