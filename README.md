 ## ROBOCON SUMMER TASK
 #### A code to demonstrate the following on Arduino and STM_NUCLEO_F410RE board:
* Working of servo
* I2C communication
* Running L298 motor driver
* Performing serial communication. 


#### OpenCV
To create a module to detect a line made of black tape on a court
using python OpenCV.
For testing purposes use your webcam, plain page with line drawn with
sketch pen or marker. The line once detected should be enclosed in a
red box.
Mention in the report the steps used and create a process workflow
diagram for the same.
Also mention the required changes in the code that have to be made if
we use a pi-cam or any other camera module.


#### Socket Programming
Your goal is to learn socket programming in C++ and python (both).
* Create a simple python server and client program to exchange
information using sockets. Input text from the terminal in the
client program.The server on receiving text from the client, will
store it in a file named data_log.txt and will send an
acknowledgement to the client
* Create a client-server program using sockets to represent a
calculator. The client is given a set of options (Addition,
Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Etc). Once the choice is
made the server requests the client for the numbers required for 
3
the operation, collects it, performs the operation and returns
the result to the client.
